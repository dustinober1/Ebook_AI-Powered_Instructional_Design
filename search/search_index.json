Agentic Workflows: The Power of Delegation","text":"<p>In a standard workflow, you give a prompt and get a response. In an Agentic Workflow, you give a goal, and the AI works in a loop to figure out how to achieve it (Ng, 2024).</p> <p>Andrew Ng (2024) identifies four key patterns for agentic design: 1.  Reflection: The agent looks at its own work and critiques it before showing it to you. 2.  Tool Use: The agent can decide to use a calculator, search the web, or run code to solve a problem. 3.  Planning: The agent breaks a complex goal (e.g., \"Build a full 4-week course\") into a sequence of smaller tasks. 4.  Multi-agent Collaboration: Different agents with specialized roles (e.g., a \"Quiz Agent\" and an \"Outline Agent\") talk to each other to produce a final product.</p>","tags":["RAG","AI-Agents","architecture","advanced"]},{"location":"chapters/05-advanced-ai/#3-localized-knowledge-shells-for-id","title":"3.
