# The ID-AI Workflow: Augmenting ADDIE

The ADDIE model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) has been the gold standard for instructional design for decades. As Devlin Peck (2025) notes, over 50% of instructional designers are now using AI daily or weekly to revolutionize the **speed and depth** of this workflow.

## 1. Analysis: Precision and Speed

In the traditional workflow, the analysis phase can take weeks. AI reduces this to hours. Instructional Designers at the **University of Cincinnati** are actively using AI to transcribe SME interviews, summarize research, and—crucially—identify implicit bias in existing curricula (University of Cincinnati, 2025).

- **Learner Persona Creation**: Use AI to analyze demographics and historical performance data to create "Synthetic Learner Personas" (Gartner, 2024).
- **Gap Analysis**: AI can ingest policy documents to identify missing competencies.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Use AI to synthesize thousands of feedback comments into actionable themes.

## 2. Design: Collaborative Brainstorming

The design phase is where the ID-AI "Co-Intelligence" loop really shines.

- **Learning Objective Mapping**: Tools like *Learnt.ai* or custom GPTs can take a raw topic and generate measurable learning objectives.
- **Curriculum Architecture**: Use LLMs to brainstorm creative themes. The AI can then logic-check the sequence of modules for cognitive load flow.

## 3. Development: Rapid Multimedia & Content

This is the most visible area of impact. Reports from **Shift eLearning** indicate that companies using AI-powered tools can reduce course development time by up to **50%**, allowing designers to focus on high-level strategy rather than rote production (Shift eLearning, 2025).

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Tools like **Courseau** can convert a raw PDF into a structured course in minutes.
- **Multimedia Production**: 
    - **Video**: Use **Synthesia** or **Meteora** to create professional video lessons with AI avatars.
    - **Audio**: Generate high-quality voiceovers from text using **Murf.AI**.
    - **Assessments**: AI can generate varied question types based on the course content.

## 4. Implementation: The Adaptive Classroom

AI moves instructional design from a "fixed" experience to a "living" one.

- **AI Tutors**: Deployment now includes Socratic tutors that guide learners without giving answers.
- **Just-in-Time Support**: Chatbots embedded in the LMS provide 24/7 support.

## 5. Evaluation: Predictive Insights

Instead of waiting for the end of a course to see if it worked, AI allows for continuous evaluation.

- **Real-Time Analytics**: AI-powered platforms like **Disco AI** track learner progress and flag individuals who are likely to drop out or fail (Disco, 2025).
- **Iterative Refinement**: AI can analyze assessment results and suggest specific rewrites for confusing questions.

### Summary Table: The Augmented ADDIE

| Stage              | Traditional Task           | AI-Augmented Task                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Analysis**       | Manual survey analysis     | AI-driven bias detection & gap analysis       |
| **Design**         | Brainstorming with SMEs    | Co-creation of objectives & themes with LLMs  |
| **Development**    | Months of content creation | 50% faster production (Shift eLearning, 2025) |
| **Implementation** | Static content delivery    | Adaptive, tutor-supported journeys            |
| **Evaluation**     | End-of-course reports      | Real-time predictive analytics & refinement   |

### Case Study: Rapid Program Development
In 2024, a global leadership firm used a strategic AI workflow to develop a new training program. By using AI-driven Analysis and Development tools (like those highlighted by Devlin Peck), they reduced their time-to-market dramatically while maintaining high learner engagement scores.
