# Appendix: The AI-ID Playbook

This appendix serves as a "grab-and-go" resource for your daily work.

## 1. The "Human Quality Gate" Checklist

Before publishing any AI-generated content, run it through this pass/fail check.

| Category | Check | Pass? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | Did an SME verify all facts, dates, and technical procedures? | [ ] |
| **Hallucinations** | Did you verify any citations, URLs, or specific claims against the source material? | [ ] |
| **Bias** | Did you scan for gender, racial, or cultural stereotypes in scenarios and images? | [ ] |
| **Tone** | Does the voice match your organization's brand (e.g., authoritative vs. casual)? | [ ] |
| **Security** | Did you confirm no PII (Private Identifiable Information) was included in the prompt? | [ ] |

## 2. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Zero-Drafting

**Goal**: Go from "Topic" to "Prototype" in under 1 hour.

1.  **Input**: Gather raw source material (PDFs, slide decks).
2.  **Prompt 1 (Analysis)**: "Act as an Instructional Designer. Analyze this text and extract the top 3 Learning Objectives and a proposed outline for a 15-minute microlearning module."
3.  **Review 1**: Tweak the outline.
4.  **Prompt 2 (Drafting)**: "Using the approved outline, write the full script for the module. Include suggestions for visuals and interaction points."
5.  **Output**: Paste into authoring tool (e.g., Rise/Storyline) as a rough prototype.
6.  **SME Review**: Send link to SME for fact-checking.

## 3. The "Power Prompt" Library

### For Learning Objectives (Bloom's Taxonomy)
> "Act as a strict Instructional Designer. Rewrite the following rough objectives to align with Bloom's Taxonomy level [Apply/Analyze]. Ensure they are measurable and observable. Input: [Insert Text]"

### For Scenario Generation
> "Create a realistic workplace scenario for a [Junior Manager] facing [Conflict Resolution]. The scenario should have 3 decision points. Each decision should lead to a distinct consequence (good, neutral, bad). Write the dialogue for the characters."

### For Quiz Distractors
> "I have a multiple-choice question with the correct answer: [Answer]. Generate 3 plausible but incorrect distractors. Explain *why* a learner might choose each distractor (the common misconception)."

## 4. AI Tool Evaluation Matrix

Use this score (1-5) to decide if a new tool is worth adopting.

1.  **Problem Fit**: Does it solve a burning pain point? (5 = Critical, 1 = Nice to have)
2.  **Integration**: Does it export to our LMS/LXP easily? (5 = Seamless, 1 = Impossible)
3.  **Security**: Is it compliant with our IT policy? (5 = Private Mode, 1 = Public/Risky)
4.  **Learning Curve**: Can the team learn it in an afternoon? (5 = Yes, 1 = Weeks of training)
