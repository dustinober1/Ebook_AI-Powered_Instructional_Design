## About This Ebook

**AI-Powered Instructional Design** is an open-source resource created to help instructional designers, L&D professionals, and training managers navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of AI in learning.

### Why This Book?

The AI revolution is transforming how we create, deliver, and measure learning. But most resources focus on the technology without addressing the unique needs of:

- **Adult learners** with busy schedules and practical learning goals
- **Workforce development** contexts with compliance, upskilling, and performance needs
- **Instructional designers** who need to understand AI as practitioners, not just technologists

This ebook bridges that gap.

### Guiding Principles

1. **Human-Centered AI**: Technology should amplify human judgment, not replace it
2. **Practical Application**: Every concept includes actionable prompts and templates
3. **Ethical Grounding**: Quality, bias, and accessibility are addressed throughout
4. **Open Access**: Knowledge should be freely shared to advance the profession
