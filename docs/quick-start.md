## Part 1: Core Concepts (5 minutes)

### What You Need to Know

!!! info "The Bottom Line"
    AI is your **creative partner**, not your replacement. It handles the routine so you can focus on strategy, quality, and the human elements of learning.

### Key Terms (30 seconds each)

| Term | What It Means for You |
|------|----------------------|
| **LLM** | Large Language Model—the "brain" behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini |
| **Prompt** | Your instruction to the AI—the better the prompt, the better the output |
| **Hallucination** | When AI makes things up—why you must always verify output |
| **RAG** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation—connecting AI to your specific content |
| **Token** | How AI measures text—affects costs and context limits |

### The 3 Golden Rules

1. **🧠 AI = First Draft, Never Final**  
   Always review, edit, and verify AI output before use.

2. **📝 Garbage In = Garbage Out**  
   The quality of your prompt determines the quality of output.

3. **🔒 Never Share Sensitive Data**  
   Assume anything you type could be used for training (unless using enterprise tools).

## Part 2: Your First AI Prompt (5 minutes)

### The RACE Framework

Use this structure for consistently better results:

```
R - Role: Who should the AI be?
A - Action: What should it do?
C - Context: What's the situation?
E - Execution: How should it deliver?
```

### Try It Now: Learning Objective Generator

Copy this prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, or your preferred AI:

```
ROLE: You are an expert instructional designer with 15 years of experience 
creating corporate training for adult learners.

- Format as: "By the end of this module, learners will be able to [verb] + [object] + [condition/criteria]"
- Include the Bloom's level in parentheses after each objective
```

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    Save this prompt as a template. Replace the bracketed text for each new project.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

!!! warning "Don't Do These"
    
    **❌ Copy-paste AI output without review**  
    AI hallucinates. Verify facts, check for bias, ensure accuracy.
    
    **❌ Use AI for strategic decisions**  
    AI is great for drafts, not for deciding if training is the right solution.
    
    **❌ Forget your audience**  
    AI writes generically unless you specify exactly who your learners are.
    
    **❌ Skip the human touch**  
    Stories, empathy, and cultural context still need a human.
    
    **❌ Ignore privacy**  
    Never paste PII, proprietary code, or confidential information.
