# Glossary of Terms

A quick reference guide to the technical, instructional design, and workforce development terms used throughout this book.

## A

### ADDIE Model

The traditional instructional design framework consisting of five phases: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation. AI is reshaping this model into a more iterative, data-driven cycle.

### Agent / Agentic Workflow

An AI system capable of autonomous decision-making and tool use to achieve a high-level goal. Unlike a standard chatbot that just answers a prompt, an agent can plan steps, browse the web, or execute code to complete a complex task.

### Andragogy

The art and science of adult learning, as defined by Malcolm Knowles. Key principles include self-direction, leveraging prior experience, problem-centered learning, and internal motivation. AI implementations for adult learners should respect these principles.

### Apprenticeship

A structured program combining on-the-job training with related classroom instruction. AI is enhancing apprenticeships through personalized learning paths, AR-enhanced job aids, and competency-based progression tracking.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. In this book, we primarily focus on **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models**.

## B

### Bloom’s Taxonomy

A framework for categorizing educational goals, moving from basic recall (Remembering) to complex cognition (Creating). AI is often used to automate the creation of lower-level content, freeing IDs to focus on higher-order objectives.

## C

### Competency-Based Education (CBE)

An approach where learners progress by demonstrating mastery of clearly defined competencies, rather than by completing seat-time requirements. AI enables CBE through adaptive assessments and personalized learning paths.

### Compliance Training

Mandatory training required by law or regulation (e.g., OSHA safety, HIPAA privacy, anti-harassment). AI helps keep compliance training current by monitoring regulatory changes and generating updated content.

### Context Window

The amount of information (measured in tokens) an LLM can retain and process in its "working memory" during a single conversation. A larger context window allows the model to "read" and reference larger documents.

### Co-Intelligence

A concept coined by Ethan Mollick describing a partnership model where humans and AI work together in a symbiotic loop, with each party enhancing the capabilities of the other.

## E

### Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS)

A system that provides just-in-time learning and support to workers while they perform their jobs. AI-powered EPSS can answer natural language questions, provide step-by-step guidance, and adapt to the user's context and skill level.

## F

### Fine-Tuning

The process of further training a pre-trained AI model on a specific dataset to adapt it to a particular domain or style. Unlike RAG, which provides knowledge, fine-tuning changes the model's internal patterns.

## G

### Generative AI (GenAI)

 A subset of AI focused on creating new content—including text, images, audio, and code—in response to user prompts. Examples include ChatGPT, Claude, and Midjourney.

## H

### Hallucination

When an AI model generates information that is grammatically correct and confident but factually incorrect or nonsensical. This occurs because LLMs predict words based on probability, not truth.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

A design methodology where human judgment is integrated into the AI workflow to verify accuracy, check for bias, and ensure ethical standards are met before content reaches the learner.

## J

### Just-in-Time Learning

Learning delivered at the moment of need, when a worker encounters a challenge or gap in their knowledge. AI chatbots and performance support tools enable true just-in-time learning by providing immediate, contextual answers.

## K

### Kirkpatrick Model

A four-level framework for evaluating training effectiveness: Reaction (satisfaction), Learning (knowledge gain), Behavior (on-the-job application), and Results (business impact). Often extended with a fifth level: ROI.

### Knowledge Transfer

The process of capturing and disseminating knowledge from experienced workers to others. AI assists through expert interviews, video analysis, and the creation of searchable knowledge bases.

## L

### Large Language Model (LLM)

A type of AI model trained on massive amounts of text data. It uses statistical patterns to understand, summarize, generate, and predict new content. Examples include GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini.

### Learning Management System (LMS)

A software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, and delivery of educational courses. AI is increasingly being integrated into LMS platforms to provide personalized recommendations.

## M

### Micro-Credentials

Short, focused certifications that verify mastery of specific skills or competencies. AI enables micro-credentials through competency-based assessment and automated badge issuance upon demonstrated mastery.

## O

### O*NET (Occupational Information Network)

A U.S. Department of Labor database containing detailed descriptions of occupations including required skills, knowledge, and abilities. AI systems use O*NET as a foundation for skill gap analysis and career pathway mapping.

## P

### Performance Support

Tools and resources that help workers perform tasks without formal training. AI-powered performance support includes chatbots, AR overlays, and intelligent job aids that provide guidance in the flow of work.

### Prompt Engineering

The art and science of crafting inputs (prompts) to guide Generative AI models to produce optimal outputs. It involves techniques like persona adoption, chain-of-thought reasoning, and constraint setting.

## R

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

A technique that connects an LLM to a specific, private knowledge base (like a company handbook). Before answering a question, the AI retrieves relevant facts from this trusted source, significantly reducing hallucinations.

### Reskilling

Training workers for entirely new roles or career paths, often in response to technological disruption or organizational change. Contrasted with upskilling, which builds on existing skills. AI accelerates reskilling through personalized learning paths.

## S

### SCORM (Shareable Content Object Reference Model)

A set of technical standards for e-learning software products. It tells programmers how to write their code so that it can "play well" with other e-learning software.

### 70-20-10 Model

A commonly referenced framework suggesting that learning occurs through 70% experiential (on-the-job), 20% social (coaching/mentoring), and 10% formal (courses/training) activities. AI is transforming all three components.

### Skill Gap Analysis

The process of identifying the difference between the skills a worker currently has and the skills they need for a current or future role. AI automates skill gap analysis by comparing job requirements to employee profiles.

### Skills Taxonomy

A structured, hierarchical classification of skills within an organization or industry. A well-designed skills taxonomy is essential for AI-powered learning recommendations and career pathway mapping.

### Subject Matter Expert (SME)

The authority on a given topic (e.g., a Chief Engineer or Head of Compliance) who partners with the Instructional Designer to ensure content accuracy.

### Synthetic Learners

AI-simulated personas that mimic the behaviors, questions, and misconceptions of real students. Designers use them to stress-test curriculum and practice handling difficult classroom scenarios.

## T

### Time-to-Competency

A key workforce development metric measuring how long it takes a new hire or learner to reach full productivity in a role. AI-powered personalized learning often reduces time-to-competency significantly.

### Token

The basic unit of text that an LLM reads and generates. A token can be a word, part of a word, or a character. A useful rule of thumb is **1,000 tokens ≈ 750 words**.

## U

### Upskilling

Training workers to enhance or expand their current skills, often to keep pace with technological change or to prepare for advancement. AI enables personalized upskilling at scale through adaptive learning paths.

## W

### Workforce Development

The coordination of policies, programs, and funding to develop the skills of a region's workforce. In organizational contexts, it refers to the strategic development of employee capabilities to meet business needs.

## X

### xAPI (Experience API)

A standard for tracking learning experiences. Unlike SCORM, which mostly tracks "completion," xAPI can track specific actions (e.g., "User paused the video at 2:00," "User asked the AI for a hint"), providing richer data for analysis.

## Z

### Zero-Drafting

A technique where AI is used to instantly generate a first prototype (or "draft zero") of a course or module. This moves the design process from "blank page" to "editing and refining" immediately.

### Zero-Shot Prompting

Asking an AI model to perform a task without providing any examples. (Contrast with **Few-Shot Prompting**, where you provide a few examples of the desired output format).
