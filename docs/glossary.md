# Glossary of Terms

A quick reference guide to the technical and instructional design terms used throughout this book.

## A

### Agent / Agentic Workflow
An AI system capable of autonomous decision-making and tool use to achieve a high-level goal. Unlike a standard chatbot that just answers a prompt, an agent can plan steps, browse the web, or execute code to complete a complex task.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. In this book, we primarily focus on **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models**.

## C

### Context Window
The amount of information (measured in tokens) an LLM can retain and process in its "working memory" during a single conversation. A larger context window allows the model to "read" and reference larger documents.

### Co-Intelligence
A concept coined by Ethan Mollick describing a partnership model where humans and AI work together in a symbiotic loop, with each party enhancing the capabilities of the other.

## G

### Generative AI (GenAI)
 A subset of AI focused on creating new content—including text, images, audio, and code—in response to user prompts. Examples include ChatGPT, Claude, and Midjourney.

## H

### Hallucination
When an AI model generates information that is grammatically correct and confident but factually incorrect or nonsensical. This occurs because LLMs predict words based on probability, not truth.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
A design methodology where human judgment is integrated into the AI workflow to verify accuracy, check for bias, and ensure ethical standards are met before content reaches the learner.

## L

### Large Language Model (LLM)
A type of AI model trained on massive amounts of text data. It uses statistical patterns to understand, summarize, generate, and predict new content. Examples include GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini.

### Learning Management System (LMS)
A software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, and delivery of educational courses. AI is increasingly being integrated into LMS platforms to provide personalized recommendations.

## P

### Prompt Engineering
The art and science of crafting inputs (prompts) to guide Generative AI models to produce optimal outputs. It involves techniques like persona adoption, chain-of-thought reasoning, and constraint setting.

## R

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
A technique that connects an LLM to a specific, private knowledge base (like a company handbook). Before answering a question, the AI retrieves relevant facts from this trusted source, significantly reducing hallucinations.

## S

### SCORM (Shareable Content Object Reference Model)
A set of technical standards for e-learning software products. It tells programmers how to write their code so that it can "play well" with other e-learning software.

### Synthetic Learners
AI-simulated personas that mimic the behaviors, questions, and misconceptions of real students. Designers use them to stress-test curriculum and practice handling difficult classroom scenarios.

## T

### Token
The basic unit of text that an LLM reads and generates. A token can be a word, part of a word, or a character. A useful rule of thumb is **1,000 tokens ≈ 750 words**.

## Z

### Zero-Shot Prompting
Asking an AI model to perform a task without providing any examples. (Contrast with **Few-Shot Prompting**, where you provide a few examples of the desired output format).
